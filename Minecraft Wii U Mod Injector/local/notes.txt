[Release 5.0]

- [IMPORTANT INFORMATION]

Hey everyone, Sloth@WiiPlaza here. (I'd prefer if you call me Kashiiera or Kiera instead.)

I've come back to update the Mod Injector to make access free once again like it was in 2018. 
I had no intentions of ever making the Injector paid but sadly XxModZxX has taken my hard work
and re-released the Injector as paid software during 2019-2020 and made money off of my work.

I've decided to release the Mod Injector's source code publcily and re-release the Injector for FREE.
This will probably be the last update to the Mod Injector ever since I've not been interested in Wii U
since 2018 ever since my channel got terminated and I'm only doing this to prevent people from being
scammed by XxModZxX to buy mods which were once free. The only issues I'll potentially fix are software
related bugs and issues, no more new mods or additions will be added.

Since I released my software for free, XxModZxX threw a tantrum and deleted the Mod Injector discord server
so if you were in it and want to rejoin the server, the invite link can be found on this page or the settings tab.
